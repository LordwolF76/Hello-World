# Hello-World


I am LordwolF76.
I started gaming many many years ago.
I learned to code using Basic on a Texas Instruments TI-99 that saved programs to cassete tapes.
I haved played with C++ during the Tribes days, making Mods for that game, but never learning to code properly.
I have been playing Minecraft since the 1.25 days, when I fell in love with a World full of Living Lego's.
I figure it's about time I actually learn to code again.
I've read a few books, but never actually committed 0.o myself to the task.
